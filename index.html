          <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Adventure motor biking, also known as dual-sport or enduro riding,
          involves using a motorcycle specifically designed for off-road and
          on-road travel. These bikes typically have a higher suspension and
          rugged tires for navigating rough terrain, as well as the necessary
          equipment for long-distance travel such as larger fuel tanks and
          luggage racks. Adventure motor biking allows riders to explore remote
          and scenic areas that may not be accessible by car. It also provides a
          sense of freedom and adventure, as well as a unique perspective on the
          natural world. However, it is important to note that adventure motor
          biking can be dangerous and requires proper training, experience, and
          the right gear. <br /><br />
          Riders should be familiar with the motorcycle's controls and
          mechanics, as well as the laws and regulations of the areas they will
          be traveling in. It is also important to wear proper protective gear,
          such as a helmet, gloves, boots, and protective clothing. Adventure
          motor biking can be a thrilling and rewarding experience, but it is
          important to approach it with caution and respect for the potential
          risks involved. Riders should always prioritize their own safety and
          the safety of others, and be prepared for unexpected challenges and
          changes in weather or road conditions.

          <h2 class="desc">PARA GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is a recreational and competitive adventure sport in which
          a person flies through the air using a paraglider, a lightweight,
          free-flying, foot-launched aircraft. The paraglider itself is made up
          of a fabric wing and a harness, which the pilot sits in and controls.
          To take off, the pilot and paraglider are launched from a high point,
          such as a mountain or hill, and then the pilot uses the wind to glide
          through the air. The pilot can control the speed and direction of the
          paraglider by adjusting the wing's angle and using the brake toggles.
          Paragliding can be done solo or with a partner, and can be done for
          leisure or in competitions. It offers a unique perspective of the
          world and the feeling of freedom and weightlessness. <br /><br />
          It's a relatively easy sport to learn, but it does require proper
          training, equipment and safety precautions. It is important for
          paragliders to understand weather patterns and conditions, as well as
          the proper use and maintenance of their equipment. They should also be
          familiar with emergency procedures and have the appropriate safety
          gear, such as a helmet, reserve parachute, and emergency beacon.
          Paragliding is a growing sport and it offers a wide range of
          experiences from leisurely scenic flights to high-performance
          cross-country and acrobatic flights, and also it is considered a
          low-impact sport and can be enjoyed by people of all ages. It's also a
          popular sport in many countries around the world, and it's a great way
          to explore new places and enjoy the beauty of nature.

          <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing is a popular water sport in which a person rides a wave while
          standing on a surfboard. The sport originated in Hawaii, where it was
          a traditional pastime among the islanders, but it has since spread to
          coastal regions around the world. To surf, a person paddles out to
          where the waves are breaking and then positions themselves on the
          board to catch a wave as it comes in. Once the wave is caught, the
          surfer stands up and uses their body weight and the movement of the
          wave to ride it towards the shore. Surfing requires a combination of
          strength, balance, and timing, as well as an understanding of wave
          dynamics and ocean conditions. It is considered a challenging sport to
          master, but it can also be a lot of fun and a great form of exercise.
          It is important for surfers to understand the rules of the water and
          to be aware of their surroundings, including other surfers and
          swimmers. They should also be familiar with the local weather and
          ocean conditions, as well as the proper use and maintenance of their
          equipment. <br><br> Surfers should also be aware of potential hazards such as
          rip currents and shorebreak, and have the appropriate safety gear,
          such as a leash to keep the board attached to the surfer, a wet suit
          to protect from the cold water, and a helmet to protect from head
          injuries. Surfing is a sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages
          and skill levels. It's also a great way to connect with nature and the
          ocean, and it has a strong culture and community of enthusiasts.
          Today, with the development of technology, many surf spots are easily
          accessible and also forecasted for better planning of the surf trips.
          In addition to being a fun and exciting sport, surfing also has many
          benefits for both the body and the mind. It is a great form of
          cardiovascular exercise, and it can also improve balance,
          coordination, and overall fitness. Surfing also provides a sense of
          freedom, relaxation, and connection to the natural world, making it a
          popular activity for people looking for a unique and challenging
          outdoor experience.
